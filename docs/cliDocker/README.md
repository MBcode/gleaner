# Gleaner Docker instance

## About

This is a new approach for quick starts with Gleaner.  It is a script that exposes
a containerized version of Gleaner as a CLI interface.

You can use the -init flag to pull down all the support files you need including
the Docker Compose file for setting up the object store, a triplestore and 
the support for headless indexing.

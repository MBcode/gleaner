# Millstone

## Notes

* set it up to work in k8s and swarm
* how to have it get/listen/receive  items from a queue systems
* needs to take an arguement for which miller path to run, this is nice
since it results in one Millstone binary for all the paths.  The binary will 
be a nit bigger but well worth it.

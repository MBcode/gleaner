It's time to remove Bleve?
It's integration is hard and I have Jena with Lucene
and other potential packages down range.  

Plus..   3rd party indexes like that should likely
be made by a tool reading the object store.

A possible exception is Tika to RDF for indexing.  
IE, TikaGraph

Convert fdptikajena into DO-Tika-graph

Work up a script or something to validate setup prior to run.

Scripts to validate the RDF afterwards
